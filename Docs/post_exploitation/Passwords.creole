== Cain and Abel

=== Import Domain Cached Credentials
Cain doesn't support importing of cached credentials so in order to do so you
 need to close Cain and edit the CACHE.LST file which resides in the
 installation directory for CAIN. Once there simply put your hashes in this
 format:

{{{
DOMAIN<TAB>USERNAME<TAB><TAB>HASH<TAB><TAB>
}}}

Where DOMAIN, USERNAME and HASH are subsituted for the details and tabs
are typed.

=== Exporting LM hashes
Some tools only support LM hashes for import/use in 16 bit form (halved and by
 themselves). Here is an easy way to pull those halves out of LMNT.LST

{{{
cat LMNT.LST | awk -F '\t' '{print $5}' | sort -u | sed -r 's/^(.{16})/\1\n/' | sort -u > LM_out.txt
}}}

== Hashdumping Tools

=== Exporting LM hashes
{{{cat domain_dump_cleaned.txt | awk -F ':' '{print $3}' | sed 's/\(.\{16\}\)\(.*\)/\1\n\2/' | sort -u}}}
