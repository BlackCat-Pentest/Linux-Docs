=== Port scanning

==== TCP Ports to scan and why

# Copy paste-able list 80,443,1433
##

# **80, 443** - obvious HTTP(S) ports, usually internally this means printers, but you could find a Intranet page or 2
# **1433** - Default MSSQL port, if you find a "MSSQL Express" installation, there is a good chance this is 

==== UDP Ports to scan and why

# Copy paste-able list 53

# **53** - finding an internal DNS server is usually a gold mine since it's rarely secured against DNZ zone transfers
